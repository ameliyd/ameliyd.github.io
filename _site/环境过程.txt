1. github.io.com能显示（建仓）

2. copy模板；push；能正常显示；按照模板作者写的：gcc g++ -v没问题；make -v无命令：
“如果你用MinGW，你的make 叫 mingw32-make” mingw32-make -v没问题；

3. 安装ruby.exe.完成后，弹出cmd窗口，执行，安装了1选项；按照知乎，又装了3选项；

4. 按照知乎执行顺序：命令gem install jekyll bundler 没问题
	bundle install：提示错误，并执行gem install bundler:1.16.2 ok
	再次bundle install：提示版本依赖：待解决：

	具体：执行gem install ffi -v ;还要加上bundle update
